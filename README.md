# DataScience-HarvardX

I will add here *fragments* of the code that HardvardX is presenting in its MOOC on EdX under the name of Data Science ( https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science )

I have audited their course contents and I found the structure of the course pretty easy to follow, the contents are really well explained and the code really works :).

The outline of the Data Science course is presented below and it is structured to be followed in this particular order

1. R Basics
2. Visualization
3. Probability
4. Inference and Modeling
5. Productivity Tools
6. Wrangling
7. Linear Regression
8. Machine Learning
9. Capstone

I have no affiliation with edx. I am just a curious human who wants to deep dive into Data Analysis/Science.
